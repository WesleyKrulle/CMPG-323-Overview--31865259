Each project will be using two branches ;
branch 1 - main branch
branch 2 - dev branch





Main branch is the branch with the working program(code is successfull and program runs)
Dev branch is the branch which the development of the coding will happen, once the dev branch code is all good, will be merges to the main branch.

feat - new feature

fix - bug fixes


changes - adding or deleting files

gitignore -  is used to indicate which files should be ignored when committing and pushing changes. Files that will be listed here are any files that contain sensitive data .

Security will be ensured by adding credentials and sensitive information in seperate files including gitignore file. By doing this the information will not be accessible by the repository itself.
